    <h1>Welcome to the Date Converter GC to EC GitHub repository!</h1>
    <p>This repository contains the code for a website that allows users to convert dates from the Gregorian calendar (commonly used in the Western world) to the Ethiopian calendar. The website is deployed at <a href="https://ethiopian2gregorian.netlify.app/">https://ethiopian-to-gregorian.netlify.app/</a>.</p>
    <p>The website is built using JavaScript and is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. Simply enter a date in the Gregorian calendar and click the "Convert" button to see the corresponding date in the Ethiopian calendar.</p>
    <p>In addition to the date conversion functionality, the website also includes information on the history and background of the Ethiopian calendar.</p>
    <p>We hope you find this tool useful and we welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvements. Thank you for visiting our repository!</p>
